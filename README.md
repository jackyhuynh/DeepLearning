# Deep Learning

## Introduction
- Deep Learnig in Practice is a collection of exercise and code that I learn from [Deep Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/)
- Course is create by [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/user/kirilleremenko/),
[Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/user/hadelin-de-ponteves/),
and [Ligency I Team](https://www.udemy.com/user/superdatascience-team/)

## Technology
List of technology
- R Studio
- Business Analyst
- Machine Learning
- Data Mining
- Data Visualization
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Python for Data Science Tools:
These are packages that are usually used for Data Science:
- [Python 3 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html)
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Mathplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Data:
Information about the data

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
- R CRAN Project: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS
- RStudio IDE: RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. Click here to see more RStudio features. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro (Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux)
- Jupyter Notebook: If you want just test the code, simply go to google and search for jupiter notebook or another Python online IDE. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
- Anacoda Navigator: Install Anaconda Navigator if you want to develop data-science projects using Python or R. Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands. 

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development enviroment running:
* [Install R](https://www.r-project.org/) - If you haven't downloaded and installed R, here's how to get started.
* [R Studio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#:~:text=RStudio%20Take%20control%20of%20your%20R%20code%20RStudio,tools%20for%20plotting,%20history,%20debugging%20and%20workspace%20management.) - After that choose R Studio Desktop, and the free version (unless you have the Pro install). R free version is pretty good IDE.
* [Install Anacoda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you,install%20anaconda-navigator.%20To%20start%20Navigator,%20see%20Getting%20Started.) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Anacoda Navigator yet, here's how to get started.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) - Click here to go to the online free Jupiter Notebook.

## Running the tests
### R Studio
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
- Start R Studio.
- Create new a project.
- Copy the data and markdown file (.rmd) into the source file. For examaple:
```
~/salePredictionSystem/markdown.rmd
~/salePredictionSystem/WholesaleCustomersData.csv
```
- you can store the WholesaleCustomersData.csv in the same folder, but it is recommeded to store in a data as below (coding standard):
```
~/salePredictionSystem/data/WholesaleCustomersData.csv
```
- Make sure to change the import code on top if you want move your data anywhere. Depend on where you download the code. Your path will definately be different from mine. Please replace the path below with your own path:
```
WholesaleData <- read.csv("~/R/DataMining/WholeSale/data/WholesaleCustomersData.csv")
# path:("~/R/DataMining/WholeSale/data/WholesaleCustomersData.csv")
```
- Please take a quick view of [import data in R](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218611977-Importing-Data-with-RStudio?mobile_site=true) if you fail to change the import code.

### Jupiter Notebook
## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
- There is no download IDE need, all you need is download all the src to your machine and run it.
- Using Jupiter Notebook
- Navigate to the file .ipynb
- hit:
```
Ctrl + Enter
```

## Deployment
How to deploy the app. 
I will not guarantee that this aplication will work "Big data set". If you are interested in "Big(or Large) data set" please join here for [an argue](https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-much-data-is-considered-to-be-small-data-Large-data-in-data-mining) on what data set is consider a large data set in data mining.

## Built With
